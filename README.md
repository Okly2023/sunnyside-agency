## CSS File: style.css

The CSS file `style.css` contains the styles for the landing page. Here's a brief overview of the main sections:

### Import and Root Variables

The CSS file starts by importing the 'Barlow' font from Google Fonts and defining a set of color variables that are used throughout the rest of the stylesheet.

### Global Styles

Global styles are applied to all elements on the page. These include font family, margin, padding, and text decoration.

### Header

The header section contains styles for the page header, including the background image and navigation bar.

### Main Sections

The main sections of the page are styled next. These include the main content area, grid backgrounds, and image grids. Each section is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

### Blog Section

The blog section includes styles for blog post previews. Each preview includes an image, title, and description.

### Footer

The footer section contains styles for the page footer, including the navigation bar and social media links.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The CSS file should be in the same directory as the HTML file for the styles to be applied correctly.
